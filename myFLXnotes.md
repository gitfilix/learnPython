### Phython is the BEST language to learn

### Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

--------------------

Integers: 1, 155, 0, -15

Floats: 1.0, 155.0, 0.0, -15.5

lists: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 2.0, 154, "mars" ]
(arrays)

dictionaries: {"name": "John", "surname": "Doe", "age": 30}
(key-value pairs, like a dictionary, like a object in JS)

tuples: ("apple", "banana", "cherry", 2.0, 154, "mars" )
(immutable order! )

sets: {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "mars" }
(immutable order! of UNIQUE elements)

booleans: True, False
